Fit Together is a cross-platform mobile app developed in Flutter. The app is designed to encourage community members to live a healthy lifestyle by allowing users to host and attend fitness events near them.

This app was designed during DeltaHacks V, in which our team won an award for the Best Use of Google Cloud Platform.
